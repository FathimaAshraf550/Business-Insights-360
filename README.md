# ðŸ“Š AtliQ Hardware - End-to-End Power BI Dashboard Project

 This project was completed as part of the [Codebasics Data Analytics Bootcamp](https://www.codebasics.io/). In this case study, I designed and implemented a Business Intelligence dashboard for AtliQ Hardware â€” a fast-growing computer hardware company. The dashboard helps stakeholders monitor performance across Finance, Sales, Marketing, and Supply Chain functions.

##  Project Objective

AtliQ Hardware, which operates across multiple countries and sales channels, was struggling with slow and ineffective Excel-based reporting. The company suffered a major loss in Latin America due to a lack of actionable insights and real-time data access. Senior executives decided to adopt a data-driven culture and commissioned a data analytics solution using Power BI.

This project aims to:
- Build interactive dashboards for multiple business functions.
- Help executives make informed decisions.
- Monitor and improve sales, financials, and operational efficiency.
