## ðŸ“Š AtliQ Hardware - End-to-End Power BI Dashboard Project
This project was completed as part of the Codebasics Data Analytics Bootcamp. In this case study, I designed and implemented a Business Intelligence dashboard for AtliQ Hardware â€” a fast-growing computer hardware company. The dashboard helps stakeholders monitor performance across Finance, Sales, Marketing, and Supply Chain functions.

**ðŸš€ Project Objective**
AtliQ Hardware, which operates across multiple countries and sales channels, was struggling with slow and ineffective Excel-based reporting. The company suffered a major loss in Latin America due to a lack of actionable insights and real-time data access. Senior executives decided to adopt a data-driven culture and commissioned a data analytics solution using Power BI.

This project aims to:
â€¢ Build interactive dashboards for multiple business functions.
â€¢ Help executives make informed decisions.
â€¢ Monitor and improve sales, financials, and operational efficiency.

**ðŸ§© Problem Statement**
How can AtliQ Hardware improve visibility into key performance metrics across its departments and markets to support growth and avoid data-driven losses?

**ðŸ§  Domain Knowledge Applied**

â€¢ Time Intelligence (YTD, YTG, Fiscal Year)
â€¢ Key Financial Metrics: Gross Sales, Net Sales, COGS, Gross Margin, Net Profit
